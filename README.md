# Regex challenge 

The UK postcode system consists of a string that contains a number of characters and numbers – a typical example is ST7 9HV (this is not valid – see below for why). The rules for the pattern are available from idealpostcodes (2020).
Create a python program that implements a regex that complies with the rules provided above – test it against the examples provided.
Examples:
* M1 1AA
* M60 1NW
* CR2 6XH
* DN55 1PT
* W1A 1HQ
* EC1A 1BB

How do you ensure your solution is not subject to an evil regex attack?
